# Nebula
Goal:
The aim of this game is to travel as far as possible in a rocket by landing on different planets.

Sounds easy right? Nope!

Planets constantly rotate at an increasing rate the further you reach! You'll need to time accordingly if you want to reach the next planet. 

# Developer Insights
This game was originally developed with the idea of getting better using the Unity game engine. The concept was to create a game which can be played with one tap, similar to games like Flappy Bird.

C# was chosen as the language of choice because it was easy to use and made sense to use within the OOP world. (It was also the only language we know how to program in at the time)!

Unity was chosen primarily because it was a popular and marketed as a beginner-friendly option. However, there's a lot of learning that came with using Unity as well. Primarily, there was a lot of discussion between where to place scripts to lower the amount of coupling between different classes. We also gained a considerable amount of experience working with prefabs, creating them and using them.

There are plans to continue developing the game, however we've only been able to work on it very rarely in our free time to do school and other commitments.

Currently, we're working to fix a couple of bugs as well as find better solutions to some of the workarounds that we implemented previously to strengthen our game.

One of the key lessons we discovered is a bug within the Unity engine. Currently, two people cannot edit the same `Scene` object or else the code will not properly run on another computer. If you plan to build upon this project then make sure you don't make the same mistake we did.
